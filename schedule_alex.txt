(Preliminary) Deliverables for Alex:
1) setup subset of data for initial testing (up until prototype)
2) brainstorm: data loading strategy for large amounts of image data processing
3) code image merging tool
4) stress-test and debug image merging tool
5) brainstorm (ref: Yushen): which high-level features to focus on first, which we need/want
6) research web image-loading solutions
7) code image processing (base for feature extraction) tool
8) stress-test and debug image processing tool
9) (ref: Yushen and Andrew) design data formats for extracted features
